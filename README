Decription.
===========

This is an experimental pet project.

At first I just wanted to play with some simple graphics on the cpu,
but then I kind of started doing other things I kind of wanted to do
(e.g. a printf-replacement with slightly different way of providing arguments and formats).

Building.
=========

To build this thing you'll need plan9's mk (either from plan9port or from 9base).

$ mk O=3
